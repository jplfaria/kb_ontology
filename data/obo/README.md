The original OBO files have some entries that don't respect the tag order specified in (the OBO format guide v1.4)[ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/pub/go/www/GO.format.obo-1_4.shtml] involving the following tags:

* created_by
* creation_date
* is_obsolete
* replaced_by
* consider

These have been corrected, and the orignal .obo files are renamed .obo.orig.
