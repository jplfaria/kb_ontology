A plant treatment is the most specific,and may be a component of a plant growing condition, and the plant study type. The broadest classes are the plant study types where the terms can be used to identify the growth study facility. Each growth facility such as field study, growth chamber, green house etc is a environment on its own and it may also involve instances of biotic and abiotic treatments and different growing conditions.

comment: This type of herbicides are taken up by plant root and leaf tissue and transported to the meristems via both phloem and xylem. The herbicide stops the activity of the enzyme, acetolactate synthase (ALS), which is involved in branch chain amino acid (valine, leucine and isoleucine) synthesis.
